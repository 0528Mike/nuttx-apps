config EXAMPLES_NSH
	bool "NuttShell (NSH) example"
	default n
	select NSH_LIBRARY
	select SYSTEM_READLINE
	---help---
		Enable the NuttShell (NSH) example

if EXAMPLES_NSH

config EXAMPLES_NSH_SYMTAB
	bool "Register symbol table"
	default n
	depends on LIBC_EXECFUNCS && LIB_BOARDCTL && !EXECFUNCS_HAVE_SYMTAB
	select BOARDCTL_APP_SYMTAB
	---help---
		Enable logic to automatically register an application symbol table
		as part of NSH initialization.  If enabled, then application logic
		must provide the following:

			const struct symtab_s g_exports[];
			const int g_nexports;

		Where g_exports is the name of the exported application symbol table
		and g_nexports holds the number of entries in the application symbol
		table.

config EXAMPLES_NSH_PROGNAME
	string "Program name"
	default "nsh"
	depends on BUILD_KERNEL
	---help---
		This is the name of the program that will be use when the NSH ELF
		program is installed.

config EXAMPLES_NSH_CXXINITIALIZE
	bool "C++ Initialization"
	default n
	depends on HAVE_CXX && HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE
	---help---
		If HAVE_CXX and HAVE_CXXINITIALIZE are slected, then this NSH
		example can be configured to initialize C++ constructors when it
		is started.  NSH does not use C++ and, by default, assumes that
		constructors are initialized elsewhere.  However, you can force
		NSH to initialize constructors by setting this option.
